SolarWinds: SolarWinds is a monitoring tool which is used to monitor network devices such switch, hub routers etc.
            We can check the status of the network devices whether it is up or down. In case if any new device is 
            installed in the environment, then we need to add them here in the SolarWinds using "Nodes" feature.
            We will get a Service Now ticket from Network team where everything is mentioned about that new device
            such as ip address, location, model name, hostname, router series etc. We need to add all details there
            while creating Nodes. Here in the Solarwinds dashboard, we will see router details locationwise.
            Let suppose, if we open Gurgaon location device, we will be able to see all the devices which is
            installed in Gurgaon location. In case any router is down and unable to login there, we will get
            "OpenGear" device which is connected to all devices in that location and give us the way of backdoor
            login.    


DataDog:    Datadog is used to monitor servers such as File Server, Printing server etc. We are able to see all the
            details about the server such as where it is created, running on which OS, DataDog Version, CPU cores,
            ip address, Memory etc. There are 2 type of tags available: Python Tags and Application Owner tags    
            (vspere). With the help of these tags, we will be able to see attributes like app contact, app 
            environment, Business Units, functions etc. With the help of DataDog, we can check when the server goes 
            down and for what time and according to this, an alert email gets triggered. We need to communicate with the
            server poc to fix it. 

CatchPoint: CatchPoint is used to monitor the applications which is running on the server. Here scripts will be created in 
            selenium language where automatic bots goes to the application and perform the automatic tasks. Each steps has
            been written in the scripts and automatic bots perform the tasks as per the scripts. For example, if we want to 
            test Gartner.com website in every 5 minutes, it will be boring process for human to go to Gartner.com login
            page> Enter the credentials> login there> and check all the tabs and pages in such short time. So we can 
            eliminate this human efforts with the scripts. We can create a scripts in Cachpoint and define each and every
            steps along with the credentials so that bots can run the scripts automatically and monitor the application
            response behavior. If the response time exceed the threesold time, it will give us an alert. We can check 
            where it fails using the FilmStrips.
